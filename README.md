Computer Vision work for football

## Pose Estimation

### Work inspiration/Idea built on:
KAPAO: https://github.com/wmcnally/kapao \
Open Pose: https://cv-tricks.com/pose-estimation/using-deep-learning-in-opencv/

### Video Samples:
Best to find videos where the QB is head on; doesn't work too well when the back is facing the camera
